For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour 
on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
``Congratulations to the crew 
of the good ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control.
The master alarm blared and red lights 
flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday.
The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw 
up their hands.
The problem was confined to one of 
Endeavour's three hydraulic pressure units.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably 
a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said.
