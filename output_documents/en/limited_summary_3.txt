For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour 
on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
The station's batteries alone, if lined up, would extend a half-mile.
The shuttle contains 
the second station component.
The only 
other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement 
part.
The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S.-built 
station part.
The astronauts 
will use the shuttle robot arm to capture the Russian space station 
piece and attach it to Unity.
