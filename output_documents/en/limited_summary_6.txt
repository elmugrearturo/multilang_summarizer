For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour 
on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
``Let's go do this,'' said commander Robert Cabana.
``Congratulations to the crew 
of the good ship Endeavour,'' replied Mission Control.
The master alarm blared and red lights 
flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday.
``We're halfway home,'' Cabana said.
``Sure, it's frustrating,'' said Bill 
Readdy, shuttle program director and a veteran shuttle commander.
The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw 
up their hands.
