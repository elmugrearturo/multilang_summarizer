For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour 
on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
The shuttle contains 
the second station component.
The six astronauts crawled out of the shuttle, and two threw 
up their hands.
That brevity was a result of Endeavour's having to 
rendezvous with a space-station part that Russia put into orbit last 
month.
The one-day delay cost NASA 
about $600,000, mostly in fuel and overtime pay.
The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S.-built 
station part.
The only 
other problem was with a Zarya battery; the astronauts took up a replacement 
part.
