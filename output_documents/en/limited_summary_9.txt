For the second day in a row, astronauts boarded space shuttle Endeavour 
on Friday for liftoff on NASA's first space station construction flight.
The decision, which followed ``frank and 
candid'' discussions between the two partners, was not imposed by 
the United States, he said.
The main cargo Thursday was the Unity module, the first U.S.-built 
station part.
The shuttle contains 
the second station component.
The mechanical arm has never before moved anything so big.
The bigger worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture 
of Zarya, and its coupling with Unity.
