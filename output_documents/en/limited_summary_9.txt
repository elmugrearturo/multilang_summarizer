Endeavour's astronauts connected the first two building blocks of 
the international space station on Sunday, creating a seven-story 
tower in the shuttle cargo bay.
The master alarm blared and red lights 
flashed just before the shuttle was to lift off early Thursday.
The job fell to Nancy Currie, 
the shuttle crane operator who had deftly hoisted and repositioned 
Unity in the cargo bay on Saturday.
The smaller gap would have been ``probably 
a little too close for comfort,'' Mission Control said.
The bigger 
worry, by far, was over Endeavour's pursuit and capture of Zarya, 
and its coupling with Unity.
